   Some Ill Shit First I need to know if I have accepted the EULA _Before_ location Management. Then I can do that in a PLIST prolly from here.

   In the View I can manually define a seque
   
   https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/using-swift-enumerations-makes-segues-safer/
   
   And present a setup View Controller that I call from here when the app loads
   
     It might have it's own NavCon Set from this NavCon Or Not
   
   This takes it further from the test Ideal
